<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy defines how FOSS Factory will use the personal information
it collects when you register and use the FOSS Factory website. By agreeing to
FOSS Factory's <a href="terms.php">Terms of Use</a> you accept the terms of
this Privacy Policy. Any use of FOSS Factory's services constitutes
acceptance of this policy's terms. FOSS Factory reserves the right to
modify the Privacy Policy.  Notice of any modifications to this Policy will
be posted on the FOSS Factory website as well as sent via e-mail to all
users. However, you are responsible for referring back to it periodically.
</p>

<a name="applicability"></a>
<h2>Applicability</h2>
<p>
This policy applies to the personal information belonging to users
of the FOSS Factory website. Third party subcontractors and other
organizations that have access to FOSS Factory users' information will
sign confidentiality agreements and will not collect, use, or disclose
your information for purposes other than those designated by FOSS Factory
in compliance with this policy and all applicable laws.
</p>

<a name="purpose"></a>
<h2>Purpose of Collection</h2>
<p>
When you register with FOSS Factory, your personal information will be
required to verify membership eligibility, process membership orders,
and to communicate with you about your membership. FOSS Factory also
uses your e-mail address to send you newsletters and updates about FOSS
Factory's services, including changes to our Terms and Conditions and
Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally, users may receive special offers and other promotional
information, from FOSS Factory or third-parties, through e-mail. Your
personal information will not be disclosed to any third-parties for
marketing purposes without your expressed consent. When FOSS Factory
contacts you on behalf of a third party, at no time will they see your
e-mail address or any other information that could identify you or be
used to contact you directly. You may choose to remove yourself from
these lists permanently by modifying your account preferences.
</p>

<p>
FOSS Factory records the date and time of the membership transaction and
creates a unique membership number that is attributed to your account
with FOSS Factory. FOSS Factory will also request that you select a
username and password for your account. Representatives of FOSS Factory
will never ask for your password, and you should never disclose your
password to anyone. Your user and billing information can be accessed
in your account preferences and can be corrected or updated.
</p>

<a name="consent"></a>
<h2>Consent</h2>
<p>
Your use of the FOSS Factory service constitutes your consent to our
collection and use of the personal information specified. Should you
wish to deny or withdraw consent to the use or collection of personal
information, any agreement between you, as user, and FOSS Factory
will terminate; specifically, your use of the FOSS Factory site will
be prohibited.
</p>

<p>
FOSS Factory reserves the right to collect and use information without
consent when permitted to do so by law. However, FOSS Factory will not
collect information in order to disclose it to government institutions,
including the police, unless required to do so by law.
</p>

<a name="disclosure"></a>
<h2>Disclosure</h2>
<p>
Except as described in this policy, FOSS Factory will not sell, rent,
or disclose your personal information to third parties without first:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Notifying you of our intent to do so; and</li>
    <li>Obtaining your express consent.</li>
</ol>

<p>
FOSS Factory may use other companies, agents, and contractors to perform
services necessary to its operations, such as maintaining web databases,
processing credit card transactions, and analyzing usage information. In
the course of providing such services, these companies may have contact
with your personal information. By contractual agreement, these companies
must treat your information in accordance with this policy.
</p>

<p>
FOSS Factory will not be held liable for any damages resulting from the
misuse of your information by these companies.
</p>

<p>
FOSS Factory reserves the right to disclose information without consent
when permitted to do so by law. However, FOSS Factory will not disclose
information to government institutions, including the police, unless
required to do so by law.
</p>

<a name="cookies"></a>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
In order to use the FOSS Factory site your browser must be set to accept
cookies. As you browse the FOSS Factory site, cookies may be placed
on your computer's hard drive that store your username, password,
viewing preference, authentication, and interface preferences. This is
done to match your information with your activities so you do not need
to retype the information each time you wish to view a new page. Cookies are
also used to keep track of your preferences, from one visit to the next.
</p>

<p>
Cookies may be used to gather usage information, such as the frequency of
visitors on the site and its pages, and the date and time of access. This
data may be analyzed to understand which portions of the site our
customers use, and to improve the site's functionality and features.
</p>
 
<a name="forums"></a>
<h2>Forums</h2>
<p>
FOSS Factory operates forums for FOSS Factory services. Users should
not post personal information in these forums, as this information
is accessible to all FOSS Factory users. Your username should be used
for such postings. For maintenance and security purposes, FOSS Factory
reserves the right to relate pseudonyms with users in order to respond
to abuse of the forums or complaints from other users. User information
will never be given to other users or disclosed to third parties, except
where required by law.
</p>

<p>
Users are free to post their personal information in the forums. Posting
information, personal or otherwise, in forums is the public disclosure
of that information. FOSS Factory takes no responsibility for any use
of this information.
</p>

<a name="thirdparties"></a>
<h2>Third Party Sites</h2>
<p>
Any third party sites linked to or from the FOSS Factory website are
not subject to the FOSS Factory privacy policy. FOSS Factory takes no
responsibility for the privacy polices and procedures adopted by these
sites as they are not affiliated with FOSS Factory.
</p>

<a name="security"></a>
<h2>Security and Access</h2>
<p>
Protecting your personal information is of utmost importance to FOSS
Factory. FOSS Factory's databanks are stored in a secure environment.
</p>

<p>
FOSS Factory users can access their account information, where they can
update, correct, or otherwise modify their information.
</p>

<p>
FOSS Factory has adopted and implemented technological and security
features to safeguard the privacy of your information from unauthorized
access or improper use. FOSS Factory's employees are also trained
in the management of user information. However, because of the
nature of the Internet, no transaction can be guaranteed to be 100%
secure. Consequently, FOSS Factory cannot guarantee the security of any
information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
</p>

<p>
You may request whether FOSS Factory has personal information about
you, what that information is, how it has been used and to whom it has
been disclosed. FOSS Factory does not charge users for this service and
will provide a response within 30 days, except where a longer period is
necessary and permitted under law.
</p>

<p>
If your personal information as held by FOSS Factory is incorrect or
incomplete, you may provide us with amendments to ensure the accuracy
and completeness of the information. FOSS Factory will update our records
within 30 days of receipt.
</p>

<a name="retention"></a>
<h2>Retention of Personal Information</h2>
<p>
FOSS Factory is required by law to retain personal information only for
as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected.
</p>

<p>
The personal information of users is retained by FOSS Factory for as
long as the user has a FOSS Factory account. Account information is
further retained for one fiscal year after the termination of a FOSS
Factory account for any reason. This is to ensure compatibility with
the schedules of any credit agencies that may be involved in billing
for the terminated account.
</p>

<p>
Certain personal information is retained by FOSS Factory
indefinitely. FOSS Factory retains evidence of your licensing of your
works in order to ensure the integrity of that licence in the future, for
the life of your copyright. This includes version information related to
each document on the site, including the user who made each modification
to the document. You maintain ownership of the copyright in all of your
own works that you submit to FOSS Factory, and you provide a licence for
the use of those works. Therefore, FOSS Factory retains the real name
and username of each account, even after termination of accounts. Since
the current term of copyright in written works in Canada is 50 years
beyond the death of the author, and this term is subject to change,
it is the policy of FOSS Factory to retain this information indefinitely.
